The core functions of the Snake Game include various aspects, and the following are some basic main functions:
1. Snake Movement: Players control the snake’s movement by swiping the game screen, aiming to consume apples that appear randomly. When the snake touches
   the edge of the game view or eats its own body, the game finish.
2. Apple Consumption: Snake keeps eating apple until games ends, and every apple shows up randomly on screen.
   Each apple consumed by the snake makes it grow in length. The game’s challenge escalates as the snake lengthens, requiring players
   to avoid collisions with the game boundaries and the snake’s own body.
3. Vibrant Graphical Interface: The game features a vibrant and graphically rich interface, with a grassy background that sets the stage for the gameplay.
   Baits are depicted with distinct apple graphics, adding to the visual appeal of the game.
4. Responsive Controls: Using intuitive swipe gestures or on-screen buttons, players can smoothly maneuver the snake.
5. Score Keeping: The game tracks and displays the number of apples consumed, representing the player's score.
6. High Score Tracking: The game records the player’s highest score achieved in any session. This high score is displayed on the game’s main screen besides the
   score of current session, providing players with a benchmark for their performance.
7. Score Reset Option: Players have the option to reset the high score. This feature can typically be accessed through the dialog jumping out when the snake touches
   the edge or its body, allowing players to clear the record to 0.
